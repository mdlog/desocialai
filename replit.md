# Overview
DeSocialAI is a fully decentralized, on-chain social media platform built on 0G Chain infrastructure, where users truly own their data and AI feeds. It features on-chain content storage, user-owned AI algorithms running on 0G Compute, transparent data availability on 0G DA, and verification on 0G Chain, aiming to eliminate corporate algorithm control and shift to a user-controlled social networking paradigm.

# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
AI Integration: STRONGLY REJECTS fallback functionality - user explicitly stated "saya tidak ingin menggunakan fallback" (I don't want to use fallback). Implementation must be purely authentic 0G Compute Network.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a React and TypeScript application using Vite, built with a component-based design. It leverages `shadcn/ui` (based on Radix UI primitives) for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, TanStack Query for server state management, and Wouter for client-side routing. It includes a custom theme system supporting light/dark modes and features an elegant minimalist design with consistent typography (Poppins font) and refined UI elements. The application focuses on core social media functionalities, including Home Feed, AI Feed, Communities, Bookmarks, and Settings.

## Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js application written in TypeScript (ES Module format), providing a RESTful API. It uses an interface-based storage system, features centralized error handling, and custom logging. Production deployments utilize PostgreSQL for session storage.

## Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions. The schema includes tables for Users, Posts, Follows, Likes, and Comments, with automatic creation timestamps and Zod for schema validation.

## Authentication & Authorization
The system uses simplified authentication with mock user sessions for development, user identification via API endpoints, and integrates wallet addresses for Web3 identity.
